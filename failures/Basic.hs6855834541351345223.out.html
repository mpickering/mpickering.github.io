If an object is wrapped in a @newtype@,
you can generate an @Accessor@ to the unwrapped data
by providing a wrapper and an unwrapper function.
The set function is simpler in this case,
since no existing data must be kept.
Since the information content of the wrapped and unwrapped data is equivalent,
you can swap wrapper and unwrapper.
This way you can construct an @Accessor@
that treats a record field containing an unwrapped object
like a field containing a wrapped object.

> newtype A = A {unA :: Int}
>
> access :: Accessor.T A Int
> access = fromWrapper A unA

We could also have called this function @fromBijection@,
since it must hold @wrap . unwrap = id@ and @unwrap . wrap = id@.

that allow to modify all function values of a function at once.
