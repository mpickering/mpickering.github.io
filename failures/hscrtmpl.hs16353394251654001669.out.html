{- This is a 'skeleton file' for writing shell scripts with Haskell

   Haskell is my go-to language for anything more complicated than a
   simple sequence of shell commands in a bash script. Doing list
   processing and a lot of logic in bash is a grind, to me.

   The idea here is to take a copy of this script and hack it to do
   what you need quickly. Throw the rest out.

   The script starts off (after the imports) with some simple examples
   in main.

   After that are a few functions that simplify things like getting
   the date as a String, logging a date-stamped String to stdout and
   manupulating an ExitCode as a true/false value.

   Finally, there is a comment block full of examples in bash and some
   Haskell code to do something along the same lines.
