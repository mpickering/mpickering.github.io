The server-side half of a typed AJAX communication channel.

To use this library, you could start by defining a type in a file that
can be shared between the Haskell Server and Fay client. For example:

@
    data Command
        = SendGuess Guess (ResponseType (Maybe Row))
        | FetchBoard (ResponseType (Maybe Board))
        deriving (Read, Show, Data, Typeable)
    instance Foreign Command
@

The 'ResponseType' argument specifies what type each command should
return. Using GADTs would be cleaner, but Fay does not support GADTs
yet.

In the server, you would then have a route that handles ajax requests such as:

@
    , dir "ajax"     $ handleCommand (commandR acid)
@

@commandR@ would then call functions to handle the various requests:

@
-- | handle an AJAX request
commandR :: AcidState Games
         -> Command
         -> ServerPart Response
commandR acid cmd =
    case cmd of
      (SendGuess guess rt) -> fayResponse rt $ sendGuessC acid guess
      (FetchBoard rt)      -> fayResponse rt $ fetchBoardC acid
@

@commandR@ uses 'fayResponse' to convert the value returned by each
command handler to a valid Fay value. Note that it takes
'ResponseType' argument and passes it to 'fayResponse'. This is how we
ensure that each commend handler is returning the right type.
