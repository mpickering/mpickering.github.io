  Module:    HaskHOL.Core.Lib
  Copyright: (c) The University of Kansas 2013
  LICENSE:   BSD3

  Maintainer:  ecaustin@ittc.ku.edu
  Stability:   unstable
  Portability: unknown

  This module defines or re-exports common utility functions, type classes,
  and auxilliary data types used in HaskHOL.  The following conventions hold
  true:
  * Where possible, we favor re-exporting common functions rather than
    redefining them.
  * We favor re-exporting individual functions rather entire modules to reduce
    the number of items in our utility library.
  * We default to the names of functions commonly used by Haskell libraries,
    however, if there's a different name for a function in HOL systems we
    include an alias for it.  For example, 'iComb' and 'id'.

  Note that none of the functions in this module depend on data types
  introduced by HaskHOL.  Utility functions that do have such a dependence are
  found in the "HaskHOL.Core.Basics" module.

-- language type classes
{-$LangClasses
  The following two classes are used as an ad hoc mechanism for sharing
  \"language\" operations between different types.  For example, both tactics
  and conversions share a number of the same operations.  Rather than having
  multiple functions, such as @thenTac@ and @thenConv@, we've found it easier to
  have a single, polymorphic function to use, '_THEN'.

  The sequencing operations are seperated in their own class, 'LangSeq', because
  their tactic instances have a reliance on the boolean logic theory.  Rather
  than unecessarily propogate this prerequisite for all members of the 'Lang'
  class, we elected to separate them.
-}
{-|
  The 'Lang' class defines common language operations and combinators not based
  on sequencing.
-}
class Lang a where
    {-|
      A primitive language operation that always fails.  Typically this is
      written using 'throw'.
    -}
    _FAIL :: String -> a
    -- | An instance of '_FAIL' with a fixed failure string.
    _NO :: a
    -- | A primitive language operation that always succeeds.
    _ALL :: a
    {-|
      A language combinator for branching based on failure.  The language
      equivalent of the '<|>' operator.
    -}
    _ORELSE :: a -> a -> a
    -- | A language combinator that performs the first operation in a list.
    _FIRST :: [a] -> a
    {-|
      A language combinator that fails if the wrapped operation doesn't invoke
      some change, i.e. a tactic fails to change the goal state.
    -}
    _CHANGED :: a -> a
    {-|
      A language combinator that prevents the wrapped operation from having an
      effect if it fails.  The language equivalent of the backtracking 'try'
      operator.
    -}
    _TRY :: a -> a
    {-|
      A language combinator that annotates the wrapped operation with a provided
      'String'.  The language equivalent of 'note''.
    -}
    _NOTE :: String -> a -> a


{-|
  The 'LangSeq' class defines common language operations and combinators based

  to why these are separated on their own.
-}

  Module:    HaskHOL.Core.Lib
  Copyright: (c) The University of Kansas 2013
  LICENSE:   BSD3

  Maintainer:  ecaustin@ittc.ku.edu
  Stability:   unstable
  Portability: unknown

  This module defines or re-exports common utility functions, type classes,
  and auxilliary data types used in HaskHOL.  The following conventions hold
  true:
  * Where possible, we favor re-exporting common functions rather than
    redefining them.
  * We favor re-exporting individual functions rather entire modules to reduce
    the number of items in our utility library.
  * We default to the names of functions commonly used by Haskell libraries,
    however, if there's a different name for a function in HOL systems we
    include an alias for it.  For example, 'iComb' and 'id'.

  Note that none of the functions in this module depend on data types
  introduced by HaskHOL.  Utility functions that do have such a dependence are
  found in the "HaskHOL.Core.Basics" module.

-- language type classes
{-$LangClasses
  The following two classes are used as an ad hoc mechanism for sharing
  \"language\" operations between different types.  For example, both tactics
  and conversions share a number of the same operations.  Rather than having
  multiple functions, such as @thenTac@ and @thenConv@, we've found it easier to
  have a single, polymorphic function to use, '_THEN'.

  The sequencing operations are seperated in their own class, 'LangSeq', because
  their tactic instances have a reliance on the boolean logic theory.  Rather
  than unecessarily propogate this prerequisite for all members of the 'Lang'
  class, we elected to separate them.
