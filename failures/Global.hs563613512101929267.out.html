-- | Types that can be uniquely declared on the top level.
--
-- Like 'Monad', this type class itself is not "magical".  Its instances,
-- however, may be primitive, at least conceptually, much like 'IO's 'Monad'
-- instance.
--
-- Individual instances may be accompanied with certain caveats.  Each
-- individual instance should include in its documentation what these are.
-- These caveats may affect surrounding code, perhaps in ways detrimental to
-- the program's performance or efficiency; users should thus consider
-- isolating "global" declarations in their own @.Global@ module; this is not
-- necessarily necessary for every instance.  See the documentation of the
-- particular instance to see how the declarations should be declared.
--
-- The type should be monomorphic, or concrete
-- enough, to be type safe, so that the references
-- cannot be treated as multiple concreet types
-- (writing @[Integer]@ to a reference that has the
-- type @IORef [a]@ and subsequently reading @[Char]@
-- can cause the program to core dump).  Ensuring
-- this safety is the responsibility of the
-- implementer of the instances of this type class;
-- other users of this library who do not extend this
-- class's functionality generally do not need to be
-- concerned whether the program will run correctly
-- at run-time, since the mistakes, which can violate
-- type safety, will be caught at compile-time and
-- the code will not build (this is, however, not
-- intrinsically guaranteed, much like the monad
-- laws: they are expected to be followed).  It is
-- worth reiterating that instances of this class
-- need to be sure to not allow code with such
-- erroneous types to compile.  For more information
-- about type safety, see the documentation of
-- 'unsafePerformIO'.
--
-- Example:
--
-- @
-- un \"lives\" =:: ([| 3 |], ut [t| Integer |] :: UT TVar)
-- @
--
-- @lives@ would then refer to the 'TVar' and would initially contain the value @3@.

-- regarding top-level declarations (referential transparency cannot be

--    prevents multiple references from being substituted to refer to the
--    same data.  This flag thus does not affect the semantics of the
--    program, but may potentially adversely affect its performance; thus,
--    isolating in a @.Global@ module may be advisable in some cases.  This
--    condition is not strictly necessary when only one declaration is made
--    in a module, since the compiler cannot substitute multiple references
--    to refer to same data.
--
--    If your code behaves differently when optimizations are enabled,
--    ensure that this flag is indeed being used when the declarations are being compiled.
--    Setting or passing this flag is NOT handled automatically by this
--    implementation; it is the responsibility of users of this
--    implementation to ensure that such appropriate behaviour is set when
--    necessary.

-- | Types that can be uniquely declared on the top level.
--
-- Like 'Monad', this type class itself is not "magical".  Its instances,
-- however, may be primitive, at least conceptually, much like 'IO's 'Monad'
-- instance.
--
-- Individual instances may be accompanied with certain caveats.  Each
-- individual instance should include in its documentation what these are.
-- These caveats may affect surrounding code, perhaps in ways detrimental to
-- the program's performance or efficiency; users should thus consider
-- isolating "global" declarations in their own @.Global@ module; this is not
-- necessarily necessary for every instance.  See the documentation of the
-- particular instance to see how the declarations should be declared.
--
-- The type should be monomorphic, or concrete
-- enough, to be type safe, so that the references
-- cannot be treated as multiple concreet types
-- (writing @[Integer]@ to a reference that has the
-- type @IORef [a]@ and subsequently reading @[Char]@
-- can cause the program to core dump).  Ensuring
-- this safety is the responsibility of the
-- implementer of the instances of this type class;
-- other users of this library who do not extend this
-- class's functionality generally do not need to be
-- concerned whether the program will run correctly
-- at run-time, since the mistakes, which can violate
-- type safety, will be caught at compile-time and
-- the code will not build (this is, however, not
-- intrinsically guaranteed, much like the monad
-- laws: they are expected to be followed).  It is
-- worth reiterating that instances of this class
-- need to be sure to not allow code with such
-- erroneous types to compile.  For more information
-- about type safety, see the documentation of
-- 'unsafePerformIO'.
--
-- Example:
--
-- @
-- un \"lives\" =:: ([| 3 |], ut [t| Integer |] :: UT TVar)
-- @
--
-- @lives@ would then refer to the 'TVar' and would initially contain the value @3@.
